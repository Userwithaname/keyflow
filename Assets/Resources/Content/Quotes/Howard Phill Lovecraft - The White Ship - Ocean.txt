But more wonderful than the lore of old men and the lore of books is the secret lore of the ocean. Blue, green, grey, white or black; smooth, ruffled, or mountainous; that ocean is not silent. All my days I have watched it and listened to it, and I know it well. At first it told me only the plain little tales of calm beaches and near ports, but with the years it grew more friendly and spoke of other things; of things more strange, and more distant in space and time.
