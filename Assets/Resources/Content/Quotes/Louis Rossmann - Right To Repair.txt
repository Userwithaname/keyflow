Right to Repair is not the concept that everything needs to be specifically designed in a manner where it's easier for me. So, for instance, if you're going to solder the drive to the board, I'm not saying, "Don't do that." Feel free to make those decisions as a company, to make your products slimmer in any way that you see fit. But if you're going to say, "We're going to specifically pair this SSD to this computer, so that even if you're able to locate the chips, they're not going to work when you put them in," that's the area where Right to Repair would come in and say, "Let's do less of that."
