In set theory and its applications throughout mathematics, a class is a collection of sets (or sometimes other mathematical objects) that can be unambiguously defined by a property that all its members share. Classes act as a way to have set-like collections while differing from sets so as to avoid Russell's Paradox (See #Paradoxes). The precise definition of "class" depends on foundational context. In work on Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, the notion of class is informal, whereas other set theories, such as von Neumann-Bernays-Godel set theory, axiomatize the notion of "proper class", e.g., as entities that are not members of another entity.
