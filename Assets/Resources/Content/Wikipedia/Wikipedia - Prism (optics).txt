An optical prism is a transparent optical element with flat, polished surfaces that are designed to refract light. At least one surface must be angled - elements with two parallel surfaces are not prisms. The most familiar type of optical prism is the triangular prism, which has a triangular base and rectangular sides. Not all optical prisms are geometric prisms, and not all geometric prisms would count as an optical prism.
